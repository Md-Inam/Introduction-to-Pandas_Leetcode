1)You always have:

Raw data (list, dict, CSV, SQL table, NumPy array)
Structure definition (columns, dtypes, shape)
Transformation (filter, map, group, aggregate)
Output (DataFrame, NumPy array, model input)
This DataFrame creation method sits at step 2

pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[...])

Data can be:

2D list → rows
list of dicts → keys become columns
dict of lists → values become columns
NumPy array → rows and columns
CSV/SQL → pandas auto-builds this internally

2)Write a solution to calculate and display the number of rows and columns of players.
Return the result as an array:
[number of rows, number of columns]

players is already a DataFrame. Re-wrapping it is pointless.
.shape is a property, not a function. No parentheses.
shape is not callable

Correct:                                       Wrong:
list(players.shape())                          return [players.shape)    # [players.shape]= [(rows, columns)]
return [players.shape[0], players.shape[1]]


Correct: 
return list(players.shape)
                                      Wrong: 
rows,columns=players.shape            rows,columns=players.shape()
return [rows,columns]                 return [rows,columns] or rows,columns..... [] a must
