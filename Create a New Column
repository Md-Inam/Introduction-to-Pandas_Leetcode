A company plans to provide its employees with a bonus.
Write a solution to create a new column name bonus that contains the doubled values of the salary column.
The result format is in the following example.

return employees['Bonus'] = [employees["salary"] * 2]
Problems:
Can’t assign inside return
return x = y  or x = 10 ❌
Python does not allow this.

Wrapped the salary calculation in a list
[employees["salary"] * 2]
That creates a list with one element, not a column

assign first, then return.
employees["bonus"] = employees["salary"] * 2
return employees

Assignment is a statement, not an expression.
Expressions → produce a value → can be returned
Statements → do something → cannot be returned

Common valid ways to add a column
df["bonus"] = df["salary"] * 2
df.loc[:, "bonus"] = df["salary"] * 2
df.assign(bonus=df["salary"] * 2)


A1)
employees['bonus'] =employees["salary"]*2
    return employees
